Customize Gemini using AGENTS.md files

Note: Agent files titled AGENTS.md are compatible with Android Studio Narwhal 4 Feature Drop Canary 4 and higher. To use agent files with Android Studio Narwhal 3 Feature Drop, use the name AGENT.md instead of AGENTS.md.
Give Gemini in Android Studio customized instructions to follow using one or more AGENTS.md files. AGENTS.md files are placed alongside the other files in your codebase, so it's straightforward to check them in to your version control system (VCS) and share project-specific instructions, coding style rules, and other guidance with your entire team.

To get started, follow these steps:

Create an AGENTS.md file anywhere in your project's file system. Gemini scans the current directory and all parent directories for AGENTS.md files when you submit a query. For more details, see How AGENTS.md files work.

Tip: Use multiple instruction files across different directories for more granular control over different parts of your codebase. For example, you can have a global AGENTS.md file at the project root and more specific AGENTS.md files in subdirectories for different modules.
Add your instructions. Write your instructions using Markdown. For readability, consider using headings and bullet points for different rules. See example instructions.

Save and commit the file to your VCS to share it with your team.

Manage AGENTS.md files as context
You can apply or remove AGENTS.md files as context for a particular query using the Context drawer in the chat panel. The AGENTS.md Files options includes all AGENTS.md files in the current directory and its parent directories.

Example instructions
You can use the AGENTS.md file to give instructions to the agent. The following are some examples, but the instructions that you provide should be specific to your project.

"The main activity is /path/to/MainActivity.kt."
"The code to support navigating between screens is path/to/navigation/UiNavigation.kt"
"The code handling HTTP requests is at <path>."
Project architecture
"Place all business logic in ViewModels."
"Always follow official architecture recommendations, including use of a layered architecture. Use a unidirectional data flow (UDF), ViewModels, lifecycle-aware UI state collection, and other recommendations."
Preferred libraries: "Use the <library name> library for navigation."
Defining placeholder names for common API services or internal terminology: "The primary backend service is referred to as 'PhotoSift-API'."
Company style guides: "All new UI components must be built with Jetpack Compose. Don't suggest XML-based layouts."
Modularize your AGENTS.md files
You can break down large AGENTS.md files into smaller files that can be reused in different contexts:

Separate out a set of instructions and save them in another Markdown file, such as style-guidance.md.

Reference the smaller Markdown files in an AGENTS.md file by using the @ symbol followed by the path to the file you want to import. The following path formats are supported:

Relative paths:
@./file.md - Import from the same directory
@../file.md - Import from the parent directory
@./subdirectory/file.md - Import from a subdirectory
Absolute paths: @/absolute/path/to/file.md
For example, the following AGENTS.md file references two other instruction files:


# My AGENTS.md

You are an experienced Android app developer.

@./get-started.md

## Coding style

@./shared/style-guidance.md
How AGENTS.md files work
Gemini automatically scans the current directory and parent directories for AGENTS.md files and adds their content to the beginning of every prompt as a preamble. If you don't have a file open when you submit a query, then the AGENTS.md file at the project root (if there is one) is included by default.

Note: If you have a GEMINI.md file and AGENTS.md file in the same directory, the GEMINI.md file takes precedence.
What's the difference between AGENTS.md files and Rules?
Rules also let you define instructions and preferences that apply to all prompts. However, rules are defined in the IntelliJ file /.idea/project.prompts.xml, whereas AGENTS.md files are saved next to your source code and are IDE-neutral. We recommend using AGENTS.md files if one of the primary purposes is to share the instructions with your team.

Note: Gemini combines rules and instructions in AGENTS.md files when processing your query.

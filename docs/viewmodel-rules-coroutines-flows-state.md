# ViewModel rules for coroutines, flows, and `UiStateScreen<T>`

This is the canonical entry point for AppToolkit ViewModel rules referenced across project docs.

For the full specification (rules, examples, and helper APIs), see:

- `docs/apptoolkit/viewmodels/viewmoel-rules-coroutines-flows-state.md`

## Why this file exists

Some project documentation links to `docs/viewmodel-rules-coroutines-flows-state.md` as the
source-of-truth path. This page keeps those links valid and routes readers to the detailed guide.
